# General review of last week

# SQlite is supposed to work as an embedded database, serverless and file-based.
## As such, we changed the project's architecture to remove the DB container and have the backend directly communicate with the volume
## If it were a service such as MySql, we'd need a separate container for this kind of service (better for scalability)
